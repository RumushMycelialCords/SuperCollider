# SuperCollider
Every piece of code that you can find on https://mycelialcordsblog.wordpress.com/ will be uploaded here for easier use.
For the time being I work mainly in SuperCollider. However, you can expect Max/MSP and possibly other enviroments later on.

I am also open to any sort of collaborations, so if you've got any idea - contact me.

You're free to use and make changes to the code I've uploaded.
If you manage to make something cool out of it, please share it with me :) Cheers!
